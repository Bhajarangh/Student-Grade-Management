# Student Grade Management System

## Overview

The __Student Grade Management System__ is a simple yet efficient Java console-based application designed to manage and evaluate student performance based on their subject marks. This beginner-friendly project showcases object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and user input validation in Java.


## Features

- Add multiple students and input marks for each subject.

- Automatically calculate average marks and assign grades.

- Display detailed student performance reports.

- Robust error handling for invalid inputs.


## Grading System

```
+---------------+-------+
| Average Marks | Grade |
+---------------+-------+
| 90 and above  | A     |
| 80 - 89       | B     |
| 70 - 79       | C     |
| 60 - 69       | D     |
| Below 60      | F     |
+---------------+-------+
```
## Technologies Used

- Java

- canner class for user input

- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes and Objects)

## How to Run

__1. Open Terminal (VS Code Terminal Recommended):__

2.Navigate to the project folder containing ```StudentGradeManagement.java.```

3.Compile the program:```javac StudentGradeManagement.java```

4.Run the program:```java StudentGradeManagement```

## Sample Input/Output

```
Enter number of students: 2

## Key Learning Points

- Understanding __Classes and Objects__ in Java.

- Implementing __Encapsulation__ using private variables and public methods.

- Performing __User Input Validation__ with Scanner.

- Developing __Console-Based Applications__.


## Future Enhancements

Implement a __GUI Interface__ for better user experience.

Add __data persistence__ using files or a database.

Introduce __subject names__ for better context.
